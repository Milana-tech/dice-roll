**Project Overview**

Dice Roll is a simple interactive web application that simulates rolling a dice. The dice is displayed in the center of the screen and can be rolled by clicking a button. Each roll generates a random number and saves the result in a history list so that previous rolls can be viewed.

**Features**

* The application displays a dice in the center of the screen.
* A Roll Dice button triggers the dice roll.
* A random number is generated on each roll.
* All roll results are stored and shown in a history list.

**Project Purpose**

This project was created to practice JavaScript event handling, random number generation, DOM manipulation, and modern CSS styling with animations.

**Future Improvements**

* Sound effects could be added.
* A clear history button could be implemented.
* Support for rolling multiple dice could be added.
* Animations could be improved.
